# Quantifying Bradykinesia in Patients Undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery
**Duke University Biomedical Engineering Research Program**

The summer of 2021, I was accepted into the Duke Biomedical Engineering Research in Engineering Program. 20 other students from across the nation were accepted to learn about bioengineering research done at Duke, conduct research experiments based on graduate student research, and meet Duke BME professors to discuss their research. 

- During the tissue engineered blood vessels module, I learned about different biomaterials in artificial vascular grafts and saw tissue engineered blood vessels created in the lab
- In the spectrometry module, we built our own absorption spectrometer and analyzed sample composition using Python. 


For my final project, I chose to dive deeper into Parkinson’s Disease. After I learned how deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce bradykinesia (a motor symptom of Parkinson’s), my experimental goal was to design and test an equation to quantify bradykinesia in patients in DBS surgery. Using MATLAB to analyze patients’ clicking patterns on a mouse, I was able to identify which patients were most affected by the surgery - both positively and negatively - using the formula.
